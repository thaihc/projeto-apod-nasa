          In this snapshot from November 18, the Full Moon was not far from
          Earth's shadow. In skies over Sicily the brightest lunar phase was
          eclipsed by passing clouds though. The full moonlight was dimmed and
          momentarily diffracted by small but similar sized water droplets near
          the edges of the high thin clouds. The resulting iridescence shines
          with colors like a lunar corona. On that night, the Full Moon was also
          seen close to the Pleiades star cluster appearing at the lower left of
          the iridescent cloud bank. The stars of the Seven Sisters were soon to
          share the sky with a darker, reddened lunar disk.
